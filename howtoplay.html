    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="/The-Number-Line/">The Number Line</a> is an idle incremental game with multiple layers of prestige, unlocks, and features.
      The basic goal is to reach as large of a number as you can, which can be spent on upgrades to boost your overall production.
    </p>
    <h2 id="number">Number</h2>
    <p>
      When you start the game, your number starts at 0 and increases by 1 per second.
      When your number reaches 10, you can spend it to buy a compressor.
    </p>
    <h3 id="compressors">Compressors</h3>
    <p>
      Compressors multiply the rate your number increases. Each compressor you buy doubles the rate.
      There exist 10 compressors with varying costs.
      The cost to buy the <var>x</var><sup>th</sup> compressor is 10<sup><var>x</var> * (<var>y</var>+1)</sup>,
      where <var>y</var> is the current number of <var>x</var><sup>th</sup> compressors you have.
    </p>
    <h2 id="exponents">Exponents</h2>
    <p>
      When your number reaches 1 trillion, you unlock exponentiation. When you exponentiate, you reset all previous progress,
      but you gain exponents based on your number. The exponent gain is <var>x</var><sup>1/12</sup>/10,
      where <var>x</var> is the number you had before exponentiating.
    </p>
    <h3 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h3>
    <p>
      Exponents can be spent on upgrades to boost your production. The first upgrade costs 1 exponent,
      and multiplies your number gain by the total number of compressors you bought.
    </p>
    <h3 id="autobuyers">Autobuyers</h3>
    <p>
      When you buy the 2<sup>nd</sup> exponent upgrade, you unlock autobuyers. Autobuyers automate buying compressors.
      You may enable or disable each autobuyer individually.
