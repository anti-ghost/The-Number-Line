    <h1>How to Play</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://anti-ghost.github.io/The-Number-Line/">The Number Line</a>
      is an idle incremental game with multiple layers of prestige, unlocks, and features.
      The basic goal is to reach as large of a number as you can, which can be spent on upgrades to boost your overall production.
    </p>
    <h2 id="number">Number</h2>
    <p>
      When you start the game, your number starts at 0 and increases by 1 per second.
      When your number reaches 10, you can spend it to buy a compressor.
    </p>
    <h3 id="compressors">Compressors</h3>
    <p>
      Compressors multiply the rate your number increases. Each compressor you buy doubles the rate.
      There exist 10 compressors with varying costs.
      The cost to buy the <var>x</var><sup>th</sup> compressor is 10<sup><var>x</var> * (<var>y</var>+1)</sup>,
      where <var>y</var> is the current number of <var>x</var><sup>th</sup> compressors you have.
    </p>
    <h2 id="exponents">Exponents</h2>
    <p>
      When your number reaches 1 trillion, you unlock exponentiation. When you exponentiate, you reset all previous progress,
      but you gain exponents based on your number. The exponent gain is <var>x</var><sup>1/12</sup>/10,
      where <var>x</var> is the number you had before exponentiating.
    </p>
    <h3 id="upgrades">Upgrades</h3>
    <p>
      Exponents can be spent on upgrades to boost your production. The first upgrade costs 1 exponent,
      and multiplies your number gain by the total number of compressors you bought.
      You must buy the previous upgrade before buying an upgrade.
    </p>
    <h3 id="autobuyers">Autobuyers</h3>
    <p>
      When you buy the 2<sup>nd</sup> exponent upgrade, you unlock autobuyers. Autobuyers automate buying compressors.
      You may enable or disable each autobuyer individually.
    </p>
    <h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      When you enter a challenge, you must reach the required number under certain restrictions to complete it.
      Completing challenges will give boosts to your production.
      You can exit a challenge if you don’t think you are able to complete the challenge.
    </p>
    <h3 id="matter">Matter</h3>
    <p>
      When you enable Matter production, your number does not increase, but you gain matter based on your number rate.
      Matter gives a boost to Number gain based on its amount. The boost is log<sub>10</sub>(matter+10).
      Matter can be spent on Matter Upgrades which boost matter-related effects.
    </p>
    <h3 id="blackHole">Black Hole</h3>
    <p>
      When you reach a 400x matter multiplier, you can reset your matter to upgrade your black hole level.
      Your black hole reduces compressor scaling based on its level. The black hole effect is log<sub>10</sub>(level+10).
      Keep pushing Exponents, Matter, and Black Holes until you can complete Challenge 8.
      In Challenge 8, there is exponentially rising dark energy dividing your Number gain.
      Completing this challenge will multiply the base of the compressor multiplier formula by √log<sub>10</sub>(log<sub>10</sub>(number+1e10)).
